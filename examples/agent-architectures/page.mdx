# Agent Architectures

At Langbase, we believe you don't need a framework. Build AI agents without any frameworks.

We’ll cover several different agent architectures that leverage Langbase to build, deploy, and scale autonomous agents. Define how your agents use LLMs, tools, memory, and durable workflows to process inputs, make decisions, and achieve goals.

## Augmented LLM (Pipe Agent)

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/pipe.png"
	caption="Pipe architecture"
/>

Langbase Augmented LLM (Pipe Agent) is the fundamental component of an agentic system. It is a Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively utilize these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain using memory.

<RunAgent api="/docs/api/pipe-summary"
	title="Augmented LLM Example"
	explanation={`This is a very simple and straightforward implementation of a text summarization agent using Langbase. Here's the breakdown:

1. Agent Setup:
   - Creates a basic pipe agent named "Summary Agent"
   - Configures it with a single system message that defines its role as a text summarizer

2. Execution:
   - Takes a piece of text about the Langbase platform as input
   - Processes it through the agent
   - Returns a summarized version in the completion

What makes this interesting is its simplicity - it's a basic example of how to create and use a Langbase agent for a single, focused task. This could serve as a starting point for more complex implementations.`}

## Prompt chaining and composition

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/prompt-chaining.png"
	caption="Prompt chaining architecture"
/>

Prompt chaining splits a task into steps, with each LLM call using the previous step's result. It improves accuracy by simplifying each step, making it ideal for structured tasks like content generation and verification.

<RunAgent
	api="/docs/api/prompt-chaining"
	title="Prompt Chaining Example"
	explanation={`This code implements a sequential product marketing content pipeline that transforms a raw product description into polished marketing copy through three stages:\n\n1. First Stage (Summary Agent):\n   - Takes a raw product description\n   - Condenses it into two concise sentences\n   - Has a quality gate that checks if the summary is detailed enough (at least 10 words)\n\n2. Second Stage (Features Agent):\n   - Takes the summary from stage 1\n   - Extracts and formats key product features as bullet points\n\n3. Final Stage (Marketing Copy Agent):\n   - Takes the bullet points from stage 2\n   - Generates refined marketing copy for the product\n\nAll stages use the Gemini 2.5 Flash model through the Langbase SDK. The example shows it being used with a smartwatch product description.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is its pipeline approach - each stage builds upon the output of the previous stage, with a quality check after the summary stage to ensure the pipeline maintains high standards.`}

## Agent Routing

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/routing.png"
	caption="Routing architecture"
/>

Routing classifies inputs and directs them to specialized LLMs for better accuracy. It helps optimize performance by handling different tasks separately, like sorting queries or assigning models based on complexity.

<RunAgent api="/docs/api/routing"
	title="Routing Example"
	explanation={`This example implements a multi-agent system that routes user queries to specialized AI agents based on the type of task. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a routing system using the Langbase SDK

2. The main components are:
   - A router agent that decides which specialized agent should handle the input
   - Three specialized agents for different tasks:
     - Summary agent: For text summarization
     - Reasoning agent: For analysis and explanation
     - Coding agent: For providing code solutions

3. The workflow is:
   - User provides input text
   - Router agent (using Gemini 2.5 Flash) determines which specialized agent should handle it
   - The request is then forwarded to the appropriate specialized agent
   - Each specialized agent uses a different AI model:
     - Summary: Gemini 2.5 Flash
     - Reasoning: Deepseek LLaMA 70B
     - Coding: Claude 3.5

4. The example shows it being used with the input "Why are days shorter in winter?" which would likely be routed to the reasoning agent.

This is essentially an AI task dispatcher that ensures queries are handled by the most appropriate specialized model.`}

## Agent Parallelization

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/parallelization.png"
	caption="Parallelization architecture"
/>

Parallelization runs multiple LLM tasks at the same time to improve speed or accuracy. It works by splitting a task into independent parts (sectioning) or generating multiple responses for comparison (voting).

Voting is a parallelization method where multiple LLM calls generate different responses for the same task. The best result is selected based on agreement, predefined rules, or quality evaluation, improving accuracy and reliability.

<RunAgent api="/docs/api/parallelization"
	title="Parallelization Example"
	explanation={`This code implements an email analysis system that processes incoming emails through multiple parallel AI agents to determine if and how they should be handled. Here's the breakdown:

1. Three Specialized Agents running in parallel:
   - Sentiment Analysis Agent: Determines if the email tone is positive, negative, or neutral
   - Summary Agent: Creates a concise summary of the email content
   - Decision Maker Agent: Takes the outputs from the other agents and decides:
     - If the email needs a response
     - Whether it's spam
     - Priority level (low, medium, high, urgent)

2. The workflow:
   - Takes an email input
   - Runs sentiment analysis and summary generation in parallel using Promise.all()
   - Feeds those results to the decision maker agent
   - Outputs a final decision object with response requirements

3. All agents use OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini model and are structured to return parsed JSON responses

The example shows it being used with a complaint email about a faulty product and poor customer service, which would likely be categorized as high priority and requiring a response.

What makes this interesting is its parallel processing approach for efficiency and the structured decision-making pipeline that helps automate email triage.`}

## Agentic Orchestration-workers

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/orchestration.png"
	caption="Orchestration-workers architecture"
/>


The orchestrator-workers workflow has a main LLM (orchestrator) that breaks a task into smaller parts and assigns them to worker LLMs. The orchestrator then gathers their results to complete the task, making it useful for complex and unpredictable jobs.


<RunAgent api="/docs/api/orchestration"
	title="Orchestration-workers Example"
	explanation={`This code implements a sophisticated task orchestration system with dynamic subtask generation and parallel processing. Here's how it works:

1. Orchestrator Agent (Planning Phase):
   - Takes a complex task as input
   - Analyzes the task and breaks it down into smaller, manageable subtasks
   - Returns both an analysis and a list of subtasks in JSON format

2. Worker Agents (Execution Phase):
   - Multiple workers run in parallel using Promise.all()
   - Each worker gets:
     - The original task for context
     - Their specific subtask to complete
   - All workers use Gemini 2.5 Flash model

3. Synthesizer Agent (Integration Phase):
   - Takes all the worker outputs
   - Combines them into a cohesive final result
   - Ensures the pieces flow together naturally

The example shows it being used to create a blog post about remote work, where it might:
- Break down the task into sections (productivity, work-life balance, environmental impact)
- Process each section in parallel
- Combine them into a cohesive blog post

What makes this interesting is its hierarchical approach to task management - using AI to both plan and execute tasks, while maintaining context throughout the process.`}

## Evaluator-optimizer

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/evaluator.png"
	caption="Evaluator-optimizer architecture"
/>

The evaluator-optimizer workflow uses one LLM to generate a response and another to review and improve it. This cycle repeats until the result meets the desired quality, making it useful for tasks that benefit from iterative refinement.

<RunAgent
  api="/docs/api/evaluator"
  title="Evaluator-Optimizer Example"
  explanation={`This code implements an iterative refinement system with a feedback loop between two AI agents to optimize content. Here's how it works:

1. Generator Agent:
   - Creates or refines product descriptions
   - Takes into account the original task and any previous feedback
   - Uses each iteration to improve the content

2. Evaluator Agent:
   - Reviews the generated content
   - Either accepts it with "ACCEPTED" or provides specific feedback
   - Acts as a quality control gate

3. Feedback Loop Process:
   - Limited to 5 iterations to prevent infinite loops
   - In each iteration:
     - Generator creates/refines content based on feedback
     - Evaluator reviews and either accepts or provides new feedback
     - Loop continues until either:
       - Evaluator says "ACCEPTED"
       - Max iterations (5) are reached

The example shows it being used to create a product description for an eco-friendly water bottle, where it would iteratively refine the description until it meets quality standards.

What makes this interesting is its self-improving approach - using AI to both generate and evaluate content, creating a system that can progressively refine its output based on structured feedback.`}

## Augmented LLM with Tools

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/pipe-tools.jpg"
	caption="Pipe architecture"
/>

Langbase pipe agent is the fundamental component of an agentic system. It is a Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively utilize these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain using memory.

<RunAgent api="/docs/api/pipe"
	title="Pipe Example"
	explanation={`This code demonstrates how to create an AI agent that can interact with external tools, specifically a weather service. Here's the breakdown:

1. Agent Setup:
   - Creates a specialized weather pipe agent
   - Configures it with a system message defining its role for weather queries

2. Tool Definition and Implementation:
   - Defines a weather tool schema with:
     - Required parameters (location)
     - Optional parameters (temperature unit: Celsius/Fahrenheit)
   - Implements a simple mock weather function that returns hardcoded weather data

3. Execution Flow:
   - Takes a user query about the weather
   - Processes it through the AI agent
   - If the agent decides to use tools:
     1. Extracts tool calls from the response
     2. Executes each requested tool function
     3. Sends tool results back to the agent
     4. Gets final response incorporating tool data
   - If no tools needed:
     - Returns direct completion from the agent

4. Threading Support:
   - Maintains conversation context through threadId
   - Allows for multi-turn interactions with the agent

What makes this interesting is its handling of tool calls - it creates a complete loop where the AI can request information from external tools and incorporate that data into its responses.`}

## Memory Agent

<AgentDiagram
	src="/docs/architecture/memory.jpg"
	caption="Memory Agent Architecture"
	height={1600}
	width={1600}
/>

Langbase [memory agents](https://langbase.com/docs/memory) represent the next frontier in semantic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a serverless and infinitely scalable API designed for developers. 30-50x less expensive than the competition, with industry-leading accuracy in advanced agentic routing, retrieval, and more.

<RunAgent api="/docs/api/memory"
	title="Memory Agent Example"
	explanation={`
This code implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Langbase. It creates an AI assistant that can answer questions about company policies by referencing an employee handbook. Here's the breakdown:

1. Memory Creation:
   - Establishes a dedicated memory storage space named "employee-handbook-memory"
   - This serves as the knowledge base for the AI assistant

2. Document Acquisition:
   - Downloads an employee handbook from a GitHub repository
   - Saves it locally as a text file for processing

3. Knowledge Ingestion:
   - Uploads the handbook to the previously created memory
   - The document is now available for the AI to reference when answering questions

4. AI Assistant Setup:
   - Creates a specialized pipe named "employee-handbook-pipe"
   - Links it to the memory containing the employee handbook
   - Enables the AI to retrieve relevant information when answering questions

5. Question Answering:
   - Asks a specific question about remote work policies
   - The AI searches the handbook in memory for relevant information
   - Returns an answer based on the actual company policies documented in the handbook

This demonstrates a practical application of RAG - enhancing an AI assistant with specific knowledge from documents, allowing it to provide accurate, document-grounded responses rather than generating answers from its general training.`}
